# Box-opener
TERA-proxy module that mass-opens boxes (any kind of boxes (gatcha or chests or whatever gives items) or mass-uses items (potions, bandages, whatever you'd like).

## Usage
Type `!box` then open your inventory and right click the box you wish to open - now it will continue opening

`!boxdelay 3000` - set minimum delay in MS for box opening, 3000 means 3 sec. (if set to 0 and by default - it would open boxes as fast as possible using their minimal cooldown - works for every box\item which gives items, for other types of consumables which give nothing set a delay else it would use default timeout of 5.5 sec while opening those)
